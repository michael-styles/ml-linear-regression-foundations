# Linear Regression Foundations

## Problem Statement
This project explores how a simple linear regression model can be used to understand and predict relationships between variables in a real-world dataset. The focus is on building intuition around modeling assumptions, interpretability, and common failure modes rather than maximizing predictive performance.

## Why Linear Regression
Linear regression provides a transparent and interpretable baseline model that makes assumptions explicit. It is well-suited for understanding relationships, diagnosing data issues, and establishing a reference point before introducing more complex models.

## Definition of Success
Success is defined by a clear understanding of the data, appropriate application of linear regression, honest evaluation of model assumptions, and the ability to explain both the strengths and limitations of the results in plain language.
